    upon HTTPS for transport. We respond with meaningful HTTP response codes and
    if an error occurs, we include error details in the response body.  API

    description: >-
      When you enter a transaction and specify a payee on the YNAB mobile apps,
      the GPS coordinates for that location are stored, with your permission, so
      that the next time you are in the same place (like the Grocery store) we
      can pre-populate nearby payees for you!  It’s handy and saves you time.
      This resource makes these locations available.  Locations will not be
      available for all payees.

      Each budget contains one or more months, which is where Ready to Assign,
      Age of Money and category (budgeted / activity / balances) amounts are
